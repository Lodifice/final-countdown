#+TITLE: Final Countdown
* Concept
  The fame of Final Countdown is a meme, because no one knows any other song
  by Europe. The same is the case for many other bands. This project attempts
  to create a list of the single best song of every more or less popular
  band. For now it's only a playlist, but I might create a service to embed
  it into popular music software later. The current list is [[./playlist.org][here]].
* Contribution
** Suggestions (band and song)
   Create a pull request for `playlist.org`. I will only accept pull requests
   that
   - preserve the structure of the Org file
   - preserve the alphabetical order
   - use spaces instead of tabs for indentation
** Requests for new bands (without giving a song)
   Create an issue.
** Change requests for bands that are already in the list
   Create an issue.
